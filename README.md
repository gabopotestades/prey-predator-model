# Prey-Predator Ecosystem

A Netlogo model of a prey-predator environment with food for the prey. The predator (fox) and prey (rabbit) moves randomly each time step and loses energy. If a rabbit is near to a fox in a certain radius, it is eaten. While if a leaf is near a rabbit with a certain radius also, it is eaten. The model stops when the population of fox or rabbits are 0.

The spawning of fox and rabbits initially and their movements are random. The spawning of leaves (food for rabbits) at each interval is also random. More information can be seen in the Info tab in NetLogo and comments in the Code tab.
